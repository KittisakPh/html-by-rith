      I'm a Junior Software Developer passionate about crafting backend systems, especially with Go
      (Golang).
      I specialize in building efficient APIs using frameworks like Echo and Go Fiber, with a focus on performance and
      clean code structure.
      <br />
      I enjoy solving complex problems by implementing logic within structs, ensuring maintainable and scalable
      solutions. I also leverage Swagger for API documentation and have experience handling secure authentication using
      Bearer Tokens.
      <br />
      With a strong interest in database testing using RAMsql, I strive to deliver robust systems and seamless user
      experiences.
      <br />
      Currently, I'm developing a Portfolio website to showcase my projects and skills while continuing to grow as a
      developer.
